# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this Pewlett Hackard Analysis was to construct a table that shows all the employees and when they will potentially retire. As well as determine who would qualify for to be a mentor for the new employees.
## Results
- The unique_titles table shows all employess born between 1952-1955. They are ordered by employee number and show the name and most recent job title for each employee. This is very beneficial when looking for specific people.

- The retiring_titles table shows the amount of people that will retire in the near future based on their current job title. This is important for the company because they can begin looking to hire more people as replacements.

- The mentorship_eligibility table shows all the employees that would qualify to be a potential mentor. That way the company can utilize them in a much reduced role rather than them retiring.

- The company needs to work hard to keep employees as mentors because there will be a lot of turnover in the next couple years, based on the amount of people eligible to retire.

## Summary
1. If everyone retired at the same time there would be 72,458 people retiring in the "silver tsunami." There is a query written to count the amount of people eligible to retire based on their job title, and when you add all those together the total is 72,458. Realistically not everyone would retire at the same time, but I would estimate that Pewlett Hackard would need to employee around 10,000 people a year to make up for the retiries.

2. When looking at the numbers there are enough qualified employees to work as a mentor for the future employees, but the company needs to work on securing those mentor's now. The need to go by department and try to retain at least 33% of the employees as mentors because they could mentor multiple people at a time. This would make it easier for the company to maintain their productivity and efficiency when the "silver tsunami" occurs.
